just a little webpage project that i spent a total of one hour on. Most of the time spent was me figuring out the web font integration because most of the stnadard fonts are not that interesting to me. 

I noticed I wasted alot of time, I started around 1130am until 230om diddling around on the internet, a discord call and the actual code/reading relevant tech articles. I feel a little bad about that. Next time I will strive to actually sit and focus for at least 2 hours and see how much farther I can go with focused intent and no distractions. I know I can do it, I just enjoy being distracted and listening to my friends chat. 

Next time, I will figure out how to upload this html/css index page to github pages but for now I am off to help one of my friends install a transmission receiver for a personal project. bye bye.
